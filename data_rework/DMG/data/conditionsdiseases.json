				"This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \"the shrieks.\"",
				"Symptoms manifest {@dice 1d4} hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of {@condition exhaustion} that can't be removed until the disease is cured.",
				"Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw.",
				"On a failed save, the creature takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) psychic damage and becomes {@condition incapacitated} with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the {@condition incapacitated} condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a {@dc 10} Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.",
				"At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by {@dice 1d6}. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of {@variantrule Madness|DMG|indefinite madness}."

				"It takes {@dice 1d4} days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion}, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.",

				"A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is {@condition blinded} until its sight is restored by magic such as {@spell lesser restoration} or {@spell heal}.",
				"Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an {@item herbalism kit|phb} can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely."
