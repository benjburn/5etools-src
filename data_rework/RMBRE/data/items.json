				"A concertina is a less charming kind of accordion.",
				"In addition to knocking out a killer polka, a creature playing the concertina can use an action to cause an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze solid.",
				"Once used, this feature of the concertina can't be used again until the next dawn.",
				"Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a {@dc 20} Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the ice. As an action, a {@condition restrained} creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful {@dc 20} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer {@condition restrained} by it. The ice melts in an hour."
