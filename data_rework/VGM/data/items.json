Any creature that takes psychic damage from the mind lash must also succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
