Beyond these commonalities, boggart appearances vary widely. One boggart may look like a hedgehog, with spiky fur and beady eyes, while another might sport the snout and fleshy ears of a swine.

Many are willing to brave great dangers in pursuit of new experiences, and adventurers are common.",
						"Lorwyn boggarts also have a knack for magic. Boggarts who feel drawn to learning and using these natural affinities often become Druids. A Lorwyn boggart might alternatively find a calling as a Ranger, especially the {@class Ranger|XPHB|Fey Wanderer|Fey Wanderer} subclass, or as a Wizard, especially the {@class Wizard|XPHB|Diviner|Diviner} subclass, as boggarts have proven fond of ascertaining information through divination magic."

They are also known for body modifications, such as riveting armored plates to their flesh. Shadowmoor boggart society is chaotic and decentralized; their communities are few and likely to be found in isolated or dangerous environments. Aunties in Shadowmoor wander the lands, greeting those they meet with arbitrary tests, boons, or even curses.",

These boggarts might become Warlocks, particularly leaning toward the {@class Warlock|XPHB|Archfey Patron|Archfey} subclass; some might believe their patron is Isilu. Others prove to be Sorcerers and are especially likely to manifest their power in the form of the {@class Sorcerer|XPHB|Wild Magic Sorcery|Wild Magic} subclass."
