You consider the majestic creature Eirdu the living embodiment of the sun, and you love embarking on whimsical adventures. You hold your loved ones close, even if only emotionally, for you've seen some venture into Shadowmoor or beyond and become faded versions of themselves. You're nevertheless courageous and always long for new experiences."

				"You are from Shadowmoor or have studied it for years. It's a gloomy, chaotic place perpetually lit by pale moonlight. You might survive Shadowmoor's merciless conditions thanks to your wit and cunning, or you might keep threats at bay with your brawn and bravery. Regardless of where you tread, you keenly understand that friendship is a rare commodity. You believe that knowing who to trust and who to keep at arm's length isn't just practical—it's often a matter of life or death."
