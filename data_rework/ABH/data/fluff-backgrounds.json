You spent countless evenings in taverns, playhouses, parlors, and gambling dens, savoring all the city had to offer. You're a natural at interacting with people to learn their secrets, whether over a high-stakes game or at a high-class soiree. You might have been thrown out of an establishment or ten, but only by people who don't know how to party."

You might have served willingly, perhaps with aspirations of one day becoming a vampire yourself. Or you might have been magically charmed and retain only a few muddled memories of your time as a vampire familiar. In either case, your time in the vampire den is over."
