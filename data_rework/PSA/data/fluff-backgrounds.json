								"You are an initiate, on the path to completing the trials of the five gods in the hope of earning a glorified death in the final Trial of Zeal. Some combination of your natural aptitude, your crop's needs, and your teachers' assessment while you were an acolyte led you to focus your training in one particular area of specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or spellcasting. But only a well-rounded initiate can be called truly worthy of the afterlife.",
								"If you are a hand-to-hand specialist, consider the {@class barbarian}, {@class fighter}, {@class monk}, {@class paladin}, or {@class rogue} classes. As a long-range combat specialist, you might be a {@class fighter}, a {@class ranger}, or a {@class rogue}. If you are a spellcasting specialist, you might be a {@class bard}, {@class sorcerer}, or {@class wizard}. And beyond this initial choice, you might consider multiclassing or using feats to round out your skills in all three areas."
