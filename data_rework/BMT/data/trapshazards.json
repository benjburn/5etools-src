When any amount of weight is placed on the stretch of beam between the characters and the fulcrum, unless a counterweight is placed on the opposite side, the end of the beam sinks a few inches and presses on a hidden pressure plate.

Any creature stuck to the wall has the {@condition restrained} condition until the magnetic field deactivates. Removing pressure from the plate—such as by putting more weight on the opposite end of the beam—deactivates the magnetic field. If the whole party has access to flight, you can make the trap suitably challenging by removing the pressure plate and having the magnetic field toggle on or off in 1-minute intervals or whenever a creature ends its turn on a different side of the pit from where it started. A character wearing metal armor or holding metal equipment who flies across the hall while the walls are magnetized is pulled to the wall and stuck to it."

Those gears remain jammed until the end of the character's turn, whereupon the Tiny object tumbles loose, falls through the gears, and is lost."
