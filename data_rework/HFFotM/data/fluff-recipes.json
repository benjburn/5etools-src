These expansive emporiums are an overwhelming explosion of scents, textures, colors, and flavors, not only making them a chef's dream but a breeding ground for new culinary ideas. Bacon-Wrapped Smoked Mussels is one such intrinsically Sigil meal on offer in many of the city's six wards. While the combination of pork and mollusk might seem unusual, this atypical culinary marriage is what makes the meal uniquely Sigil. An inspired combination of surf and turf, this dish has made its way across the multiverse as far as the Cutlass of Luskan on Toril, where fresh mussels are harvested in droves from the Sea of Swords, while the cured bacon is brought in almost daily from Mirabar via the River Mirar."

It is important to note that although garlic is a flavorful and inspired touch, it is not indigenous to the region. You'll find this pungent bread pairs nicely with a main of medium-rare wolf steak and a glass of Wizard of Wines' Champagne du le Stomp or Red Dragon Crush, but avoid the {@recipe Purple Grapemash No. 3|HFFotM} at all costs."

Any bread with beer in the dough is considered a beer bread, and the results are usually as middling as the common brew. However, this recipe from Fortune's Wheel yields a moist and chewy loaf that is bound to become a mealtime staple on any dinner table. Different types of beer yield distinctive flavors of bread and, depending on the varietal, it may even add leavening to the baking process, changing the ultimate density of the loaf. But regardless of the beer you choose (the Fortune's Wheel uses a dark, dry stout), it's all about the quality of the batter."

The city's proximity to forests, rich farmland, and the sea made it an obvious destination for chefs and diners from across the Realms. And few dishes stood out more than Beluir's famous poached salmon. Available at virtually any eating house in town, the most traditional preparation came from the Friendly Burrow tavern, which created a mouthwatering spread, comprising both fresh and smoked salmon, herbs, cream cheese, and a touch of cayenne, served atop a baguette with a sprinkle of capers. If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate \"tall folk\" guests who needed a rest after all that dining. While Luiren is no more, this famous dish can still be found on board various halfling-crewed spelljammers who commandeered this dish as their own."

Brackleberry Jam is as common as butter in the forest-heavy country of Cormyr, where its topography and climate yield an abundance of seasonal berries so plentiful they colorfully adorn the region's roads and trails. This jam spreads well on almost any warm loaf or muffin. In the Feywild, the berries are not only more bountiful but also more flavorful, resulting in an exquisite local variety of Brackleberry Jam."

Breaded Bird Cutlets are primarily served seasoned, lathered with butter, and spritzed with lemon, although breadings and sauces can vary greatly depending on the world and the occasion.

But one thing you will know is she makes them hot: with the sort of spices mortals should avoid unless in ethereal form. The chickpeas offer a starchy and earthy sanctuary from the oily, spicy sausage and red pepper flakes, all of it swimming in a garlicky chicken broth, flavored with tomato. Common variations on this dish introduce tarragon for a pungent and inspired twist on the classic. Although widely available, and often considered a meal for the masses, this is nonetheless a delectable soup that has rightfully earned its place in the heart of many citizens of the greater multiverse."

Senior cook Jarandur Tallstand adapted the traditional wood-elven forest salad, or chopforest, as it has been called, to complement the heavier menu options with its mix of peppered leaves, olives, fennel, and tangy vinaigrette dressing. It is said that a chopforest delivered unto your table, compliments of Yawning Portal proprietor and Undermountain gatekeeper {@creature Durnan|WDH}, is a happy omen before one's descent to Undermountain."

These rich little pastries, traditionally stuffed with a local chicken sausage and Goldenfields batatas and leeks, are known for their distinctive triangular shape. Vendors sell them everywhere, and their heartiness will tide you over until you can manage a sit-down meal. Varieties of the goldenstar have spread throughout the Sword Coast, from the river's end at Baldur's Gate to as far north as Neverwinter. But every time you eat one done right, you'll be brought back to the docks of Berdusk."

				"Blackbread is a palm-size circular loaf of pumpernickel that demands to be served warm and topped with sweet butter. A base of stone-ground cornmeal, dark rye flour, and a dash of unsweetened cocoa bolster the dark colors and texture. Buttermilk, molasses, and dark brown sugar round out this versatile bread with an almost honeyed nuance, which dips nicely in surplus gravy. You aren't doing it right unless a sizable slab of salted yak butter or the like is slathered on top to melt into its deep, dark nooks. A fancier version, usually served as a meal in itself, has currants or dried fruits rolled in, providing an even chewier and heartier experience. Blackbread is often sold in loaves by the bunch, but they are equally delectable in a portable muffin form, as they are served at the Green Dragon Inn in the Free City of Greyhawk. Blackbread's versatility makes it a great day starter reheated in a skillet, with—you guessed it—additional butter glistening atop. A notable version of this exists in loaf form in Saltmarsh and its nautical outskirts. In truth, whether eaten from a loaf or as a muffin, it's a classic and frugal dark bread that finds its way into many a larder."

These allium-based pancakes are an inexpensive and unexpectedly filling treat that pairs easily with savory roast meats. They're also delicious served solo, when dolloped with fresh cream and pureed fig spread for a uniquely Netherese experience. In many regions, scallions are an equally acceptable base vegetable that offers a pancake with a milder flavor. Regardless of how one chooses to consume this pan-fried appetizer, the culinary experience is one of the few good reasons to come to the Shadowfell."

In contrast, citizens of the Outer Planes imbibe numerous spiced and creamed variants of kaeth, including the notable Mountain Majesty of Mount Celestia. On the planet Oerth, coffee trends more acidic and is frequently blended into creamy liquors to grant an extra kick. But perhaps the most notable, kav'la, in which creamed coconut milk is swirled into a malted, dark, nutty roast, is served in tall, ornate ceramic vessels and is easily found in the cultured bazaars of Sigil.

Stale bread was separated from other half-finished morsels; soaked in water; sugared, spiced, and dried; then served up as what was known as kender loaf, the pre-owned bread.

Served sizzling-hot right out of the skillet, with just a hint of garlic and garden spices, rothé steak is a carnivore's delight and the perfect protein for a triumphant or aspiring adventurer. Along the Sword Coast, you can easily source fresh {@creature rothé|VGM} that is either farm-raised or wild game—there are devotees of both. Why bother with any vegetable sides?

				"Ruby cordial is traditionally a saccharine swill of liquefied dark cherries blended into a fortified wine from the southern Moonshae Islands, where the aperitif first originated. While any cherries will do, the cherries of choice originate from the same rustic archipelago where they ripen in the sandy island soil, which imbues them with a sweet, robust flavor. Distilling cherry stems, skins, and even pits into the liqueur activates an almost nutty layer of flavor that hits right after the initial sugary wave passes. The Blade and Stars, a tried-and-true establishment in the port city of Baldur's Gate, offers a remarkable interpretation of this offshore staple using a traditional ruby port instead of fermented Moonshae cherry juices. Even better, the Blade serves food and drink right in the guest rooms, ensuring that no one will notice just how many of these wondrous cocktails are consumed."

Traditional elven sornstag is slow smoldered with ground coriander, cumin, and hotspice or curry in a thick broth and is a popular plate among wood elves during the Highharvestide Festival. Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road."

It even contains a freshwater lake (Lake Bral), frequently refilled by water harvested from ice asteroids, and, yes, livestock in the form of swine. Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers was a favorite of the famed Captain Bral and has remained a signature dish on the menu of the Laughing Beholder, run by gregarious beholder Large Luigi, and other notably unsavory eateries that dot the avenues of this lawless asteroid outpost. When ordered \"the Captain's way,\" the explosion of spices (paprika, coriander, cayenne, garlic, fennel, cumin, and some mystery space seed grown onsite) combined with the zest of the orange peppers is like a peg-legged dohwar kick straight to the taste buds."

				"Whole roast boar, or some parts thereof, is a favorite at the banquets of vampire hosts throughout the Domains of Dread. It is rumored that hosts wait until their guests are \"glassy of eye, greasy of chin, and a drowsy cheer has come upon them\" to insert a single fang to the jugular of each guest and exsanguinate to their taste. Proper preparation requires of the cook an unabashed love of jam, port, and brown sugar, applied with a heavy hand to flavor the meat, ensuring that you and your guests will leave nothing on your plates. For those lucky travelers fortunate enough to escape the fog-shrouded confines of Barovia to Toril, a variation of this hearty and succulent feast is a specialty of the Boar with Black Tusks in Noanar's Hold, which sometimes uses pork when a boar cannot be procured and is often served with a dry ruby wine from Cormyr."
