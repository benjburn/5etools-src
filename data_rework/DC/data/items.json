At the end of their turn, the grenade explodes. All creatures within 60 feet of the grenade when it explodes suffer the following effects:",

The possibilities here are broad, but in combat it's simplest to allow them the opportunity to \"rewind\" one action and take it again, or to reroll a failed saving throw (if it can still take actions).",

				"If a creature bound its soul to the ruinstone in the \"Thalivar's Beacon\" quest, the artifact explodes when used and the creature who is bound to it disintegrates, disappearing from reality and can only be brought back with a {@spell wish} spell, or similar magic."
