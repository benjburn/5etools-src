				"This {@variantrule haunted traps|VRGR|haunted trap} affects a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on an ancient but pristine instrument. When a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant, mournful music. A round later, a phantom performer appears and begins playing the instrument for the next minute. While the performer plays, any creature that enters or starts its turn in the haunted trap's area must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or float 20 feet into the air and be affected by the spell {@spell Otto's irresistible dance}. There they are joined by illusory dancers as they dance for the remainder of the performer's song. As an action, a dancing creature can repeat the saving throw to end the effect on itself, whereupon it falls 20 feet and takes {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage. If a creature's saving throw to resist the trap or to stop dancing is successful, the creature is immune to the haunted trap for the next 24 hours.",
				"While the phantom performer plays, any creature within the haunted trap's area can use an action to try to convince the performer to stop playing, doing so with a successful {@dc 14} Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. When the performer stops playing, all creatures affected by the haunted trap are freed from its effects and float to the ground safely."

				"This {@variantrule haunted traps|VRGR|haunted trap} affects a 15-foot-cube in front of an ornate mirror hanging on a wall. When a visible creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the creature's distorted reflection in the mirror. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, it must succeed on a {@dc 12} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, and rendered unable to speak for 1 minute. Additionally, an illusion makes it appear that the creature has had its face erased. The {@spell remove curse} spell ends this effect, as does destroying the mirror. The mirror has AC 12, 10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. After a creature fails its saving throw against the trap, the trap won't activate again for 24 hours."

				"This {@variantrule haunted traps|VRGR|haunted trap} is tied to the 10-foot-radius sphere surrounding an ominous, 1-foot-tall statue of a menacing, four-winged, birdlike figure. Once per day, when a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant flapping wings and a rush of warm air. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} and {@condition incapacitated} for 1 minute. These conditions last until the creature is damaged or someone else uses an action to shake the creature. If the affected creature remains {@condition charmed} for the full minute, they are then affected as per the spell {@spell magic jar}, their soul entering the statue and being replaced by the spirit of a disembodied fiend. This effect ends when {@spell dispel evil and good} or a similar spell is cast on the affected creature, or when the statue is destroyed. The statue has AC 17, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.",
				"This haunted trap manifests as the result of a fiendish influence. Casting {@spell dispel evil and good} on the statue permanently disarms the haunted trap."

				"A morbid memory trap presents little danger, but it proves useful in revealing important and unsettling glimpses into an area's past. This {@variantrule haunted traps|VRGR|haunted trap} affects a single room or 30-foot-square area. When a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as faint, disembodied whispers. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, an illusory scene plays out, repeating some terrible event that happened in the area. This vision typically lasts 1 minute. When the vision ends, all creatures in the area that saw the illusion must succeed on a {@dc 10} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of the area for the next {@dice 1d4} rounds. {@condition Frightened} creatures must take the {@action Dash} action and move away from the haunted area by the safest available route on each of their turns, unless there is nowhere else to move. After the haunted trap is activated, it won't activate again for 24 hours."
