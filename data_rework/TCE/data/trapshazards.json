				"A typical avalanche (or rockslide) is 300 feet wide, 150 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in the path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if they're close to its edge, but outrunning one is almost impossible.",
				"When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures must roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative counts 10 and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet until it can travel no more. When an avalanche moves, any creature in its space moves along with it and falls {@condition prone}, and the creature must make a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw, taking {@damage 1d10} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
				"When an avalanche stops, the snow and other debris settle and bury creatures. A creature buried in this way is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, and it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover}. The creature gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion} for every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action, breaking the surface and ending the {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained} conditions on itself with a successful {@dc 15} Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again.",
				"A creature that is not {@condition restrained} or {@condition incapacitated} can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature. Once free, that creature is no longer {@condition blinded} or {@condition restrained} by the avalanche."

A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes {@damage 1d4} slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.",
				"A flaywind leaves {@dice 4d6} feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or ({@skill Nature}) check or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check allows a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter.
