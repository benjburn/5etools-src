				"You are scarred by knowledge you shouldn't possess. Your eyes turn black, except for your pupils, which turn white. This charm grants you advantage on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to interact with evil creatures. Additionally, you can cast the spell {@spell eyebite} as an action. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this charm). Once you cast this spell, you can't cast it again until the next dawn. This charm vanishes after 13 days, when your appearance returns to normal."

The dragon appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you and aids you for 10 minutes. Afterward, the time dragon vanishes, and the scale crumbles."
