While out on their mission, the scribes saw colors in the outer plane that they had never seen before. Overcome by a manic need to capture the experience, the young scribes rushed back to the Hearth to compare notes. Soon they were taking turns devising drinks from the bottles behind the bar that might capture the colors that haunted their minds. They were never truly able to re-create that dance of light and magic, but they agreed that the flavor of this cocktail came closest to the way the colors of the astral plane felt."

Merilyn kept Minsc's drink untouched on the bar, and with a touch of magic, the tonic did not lose a single bubble over the ensuing decades. None were allowed to disturb it.

				"Honey-sweet, effervescent, and as floral as a garden on a warm spring day, Feywine has a unique reputation among elves, who associate it almost exclusively with celebrations and victory feasts. Liset Cheldar, the half-elf current proprietor of the Moonstone Mask, stirred controversy when she started serving Feywine to her customers, as the proper recipe for Feywine is not supposed to be shared outside of elven society. A delegation of elven dignitaries descended on the bar to taste her offering and left satisfied, which led many observers to conclude that Liset could not be serving real Feywine but instead a homemade punch \"inspired\" by the true recipe and not subject to elven prohibitions!",
				"Whether the Feywine at the Mask is made from the breath of moonlight captured in glistening dew on the skin of rare grapes in the Feywild or by mixing strong liquor with fruit juice and sparkling wine, no one can say for sure. Liset's Feywine certainly has the desired effect of the original in making patrons merry!"

				"There were two silent monks who lived centuries ago at a temple near Baldur's Gate and they shared a loving bond of devotion as great as any offered to the gods. The story goes that when one of the pair lay on the threshold of death, the other gestured for the reaper to sit and take tea. The monk prepared a syrup of rosemary, the herb of remembrance. He brewed two cups of green tea and set them on the doorstep on a chilly morning to slowly steep and develop flavor. The monk used this time to cherish the last hours of his beloved friend's life and to set firm in his memory all that he loved about him. He and the reaper drank together in quiet contemplation, enjoying the sweetness of honey, the savor of rosemary, and the vivacity of green tea. This drink is now served at the Hissing Stones and always enjoyed in silent remembrance."

Beyond the environmental challenges of the desert and the rivalry of other hunters in a lawless land, they face a high likelihood of death thanks to Netherese creatures, traps, and ancient spells scattered across the sands. The Gilded Horseshoe is the last stop before the desert for many of these hunters. This golden cocktail with honey is often their last drink before they depart, and perhaps their last drink ever."
