In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as {@deity Torm}, {@deity Heironeous|Greyhawk}, and {@deity Kiri-Jolith|Dragonlance}) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as {@deity Erythnul|Greyhawk}, {@deity the Fury|Eberron}, {@deity Gruumsh|Nonhuman}, and {@deity Ares|Greek}) and gods of conquest and domination (such as {@deity Bane}, {@deity Hextor|Greyhawk}, and {@deity Maglubiyet|Nonhuman}). Other war gods (such as {@deity Tempus}, {@deity Nike|Greek}, and {@deity Nuada|Celtic}) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.",
