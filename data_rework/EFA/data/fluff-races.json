				"With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.",
				"The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those who have never set foot in the fey realm.",
				"In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see one in that form, for a typical changeling alters their shape the way others might change clothes. However, many changelings develop identities with more depth, crafting a persona complete with history and beliefs to go with each shape. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.",
				"Multiple changelings can share a persona. Personas can even pass down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users."

				"Kalashtar (pronounced kal-ASH-tar) are created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits called quori from the plane of dreams. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. They have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are concentrating or expressing strong emotions.",
				"Kalashtar can't communicate directly with their quori spirits. Rather, kalashtar might experience them as a source of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the spirits' memories when the kalashtar sleep. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psionic attacks."

				"Over the course of centuries, those descended from both humans and elves have developed their own communities and traditions in Khorvaire. The rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani has strengthened this identity. Members of these communities call themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire,\" as they dislike the term \"half-elf.\"",
				"Many Khoravar espouse the idea of being \"the bridge between,\" believing they are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others, fascinated by their distant connection to the Fey, seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become druids or warlocks with archfey patrons."

				"Shifters resemble humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also possess prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, the shifter remains clearly identifiable as a Humanoid even when at their most feral."

Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. The more a warforged cultivates their individuality, the more likely they are to modify their body, seeking out an artifi cer to customize the look of their face, limbs, and plating."
