You might have formed an association with the House Tarkanan criminal organization (named for one of the most notorious leaders of the aberrant dragonmarked in the War of the Mark twenty-five centuries ago). Or you might struggle to find your own way in the world, relying on your wits and the power of your mark."

Some archaeologists plunder the treasures of the past in search of wealth or fame, but most consider it their calling to learn from the past. In any case, the archaeologists of Eberron combine the qualities of learned historians with the grit of treasure hunters."
