				"When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you moves, you can use your reaction to give the creature the {@condition prone} condition. Allies of the target who are within 30 feet of the target must succeed on a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition stunned} condition until the end of their next turn as they laugh uncontrollably at their friend's misfortune. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you."
