				"A magical mist creeps through the jungles of Chult. Contact with this thin, blue, odorless mist can infect giants and humanoids with blue mist fever. A {@spell dispel magic} spell destroys the mist in a 20-foot square starting at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range. An encounter with this mist typically covers {@dice 1d6} such areas (400-2,400 square feet).",
				"A giant or humanoid that comes into contact with the mist must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or become infected with blue mist fever. An infected creature begins seeing vivid hallucinations of blue monkeys {@dice 1d6} hours after failing the save, and the hallucinations last until the disease ends on the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending the effect on itself on a success."

				"Insects native to the jungles and marshes of Chult carry this disease, shivering sickness. The easiest protection against it is a coating of insect-repelling salve on all exposed skin (for the cost of insect repellent, see {@adventure \"Buying a Special Item\"|ToA|1|Buying a Special Item}.",
				"A giant or humanoid that takes damage from {@creature Swarm of Insects||insect swarms} or from {@creature giant centipede||giant centipedes}, {@creature giant scorpion||giant scorpions}, or {@creature giant wasp||giant wasps} is exposed to the disease at the end of the encounter. Those who haven't applied insect repellent since their previous long rest are exposed to the disease when they finish a long rest.",
				"A giant or humanoid exposed to the disease must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or become infected. A creature with natural armor has advantage on the saving throw. It takes {@dice 2d6} hours for symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include blurred vision, disorientation, and a sudden drop in body temperature that causes uncontrollable shivering and chattering of the teeth.",
				"Once symptoms begin, the infected creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from a long rest. The infected creature also has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. At the end of a long rest, an infected creature repeats the saving throw, shaking off the disease on a successful save."

				"Minuscule parasites known as throat leeches infect the water in Chult's forests, swamps, and rivers. Any giant or humanoid that swallows tainted water must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be infested with throat leeches. Immediate symptoms include throat inflammation and shortness of breath. After {@dice 1d6} hours, the infected character gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion} that can't be removed (except as described below) until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's {@condition exhaustion} increases by 1 level; on a successful save, the creature's {@condition exhaustion} decreases by 1 level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of {@condition exhaustion} below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.",
				"Explorers can avoid contracting throat leeches by drinking only rainwater or water that's been boiled or magically purified."
