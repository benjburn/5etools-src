				"Following the devastation of the distant continent of Otaria in Karona's War some two and a half centuries ago, people of many races left that land to find refuge elsewhere. Among them were the birdlike people called aven, who were largely unknown outside of Otaria prior to their exodus. Rather than dispersing around the world and assimilating into local cultures, they wandered in great flocks, forming separate communities in a few hospitable locations. The largest such flock settled in Benalia, where its people submitted themselves to Benalish law in exchange for hospitality. The aven have no representation on the Council of Seven, but many hope to see that change.",
				"Aven have humanlike bodies, arms, and legs, with wings and heads resembling those of eagles. Their lean forms are covered with feathers, and their arms and legs all end in sharp talons.",
				"Aven form their own airborne companies, or wings, within the Benalish army. They serve as soldiers, battle priests, and occasionally heroes, but do not become knights except under truly exceptional circumstances. Worship of Serra is all but universal among the aven because of syncretistic fusion with their traditional religious beliefs, and many aven are Serran acolytes."

				"The people of Keld are human, but they are like no other humans anywhere. Nearly all adults stand over six feet tall, and heights above seven feet are not uncommon. They are massively muscled and have gray skin, ranging from an ashy gray-white to a deeper blue-gray. The typical {@race Human (Keldon)|PSD}'s hairline points sharply down in the middle of the forehead and at either temple, but recedes elsewhere—sometimes dramatically. {@race Human (Keldon)|PSD|Keldons} are remarkably resistant to the cold of their homeland, baring skin even in near-freezing temperatures without discomfort.",
				"Keldons value self-reliance, strength, and courage above all else. Anything that is the product of their own labor is a fine thing. Anything else is treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. At best, they are a proud, pragmatic, passionate people, and their loyalty is fierce once earned. At worst, they can be reckless, hot-tempered, and violent—and no small number of Keldons still consider these qualities virtues rather than vices.",
				"Because of their many exploits as both conquerors and mercenaries, Keldons appear in the legends and histories of other peoples across the world. Sometimes these tales are exaggerated—but many that sound exaggerated are not."
