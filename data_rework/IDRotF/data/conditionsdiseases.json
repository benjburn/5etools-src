				"Any humanoid that spends 12 hours in the necropolis must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or contract an arcane blight. This magical disease transforms the humanoid into a {@creature nothic}, but only after the victim experiences hallucinations and feelings of isolation and paranoia. Other symptoms include clammy skin, hair loss, and myopia (nearsightedness).",
				"A player character infected with the arcane blight gains the following flaw: \"I don't trust anyone.\" This flaw, which supersedes any conflicting flaw, is fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.",
				"Whenever it finishes a long rest, an infected humanoid must repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for future saves against the arcane blight drops by {@dice 1d6}. If the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature overcomes the arcane blight and becomes immune to the effect of further exposure. A creature that fails three of these saving throws transforms into a {@creature nothic} under the DM's control. Only a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.",
				"A {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic ends the infection on the target, removing the flaw and all other symptoms, but this magic doesn't protect the target against further exposure."
